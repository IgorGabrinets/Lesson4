        <p>The AMG E63 S goes mostly unchanged for the 2023 model year, save for the addition of the Final Edition
            equipment package. Only 999 Final Edition models will be built and all of them will be coated in a Matt
            Graphite Grey Magno exterior finish paired with the AMG Night Package, which includes high-gloss black
            accents as well as tinted glass from the B-pillar back. For more exclusivity, customers can add one or both
            Carbon Packages, which dress up the exterior with carbon fiber components.
